### Projects
**EKG Illness Classifier**

Worked with fellow students at MSOE to create an EKG Illness Classifier during the height of the pandemic. Below, you can find details on the project results.

**Steam Classification Project**

At MSOE, I had the opportunity to work with my classmates on several long term projects. One of my favorite projects was where my teammates and I worked on trying to identify the price of a new Steam game using historical data. the results of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/kylerodrigues18/Steam-Classification/blob/main/cs3300_final_project.ipynb).

**3D Printing**

I've unfortunately caught the 3D printing bug and now spend way too much free time tinkering with my Ender 3 Pro printer and using Autodesk Fusion 360 to create new models. Most of the time, I use my 3D printer to print figurines/nameplates for birthday presents.
